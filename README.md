# Band Name Generator

This simple Python script generates a band name based on the city you grew up in and the name of a pet.

## How It Works

The script prompts the user to input the following:
- The name of the city they grew up in.
- The name of a pet.

It then combines these two inputs to create a band name and prints it out.
